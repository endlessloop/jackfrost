Architectural flaws or things to improve in this component:

* the autocomplete search is only done against database. no cache is done.
  (reason: the jQuery component does not allow multisourcing).
* the multichoice component doesn't work against M2M relationships with THROUGH set.
  (reason: the values are SET checking the objects against the query in the other side of the relationship, not the intermediary values).

TO-DO:

* error handling events for the autocomplete hit (letting the users notify theirself about the error).
* custom per-channel captions (allowing a fallback to __unicode__() in the model if not custom caption generator specified).
* initialization events for the fk and m2m values in place of triggering the "set" and "add" event pairs.

TO-TEST

*( ) Events (again, including the error handling event).
*( ) Initialization (in contrast with normal setting/adding).
*{ } Allow caching/multisourcing.
*{ } Intensive documentation!

NOTE: this code has an example of sourcing from local cache AND remote database.
(simple URL source performs a lookup and gets a JSON response using GET. this
sample code is the exact same except for the caching code).

$( "#birds" ).autocomplete({
    minLength: 2,
    source: function( request, response ) {
        var term = request.term;
        if ( term in cache ) {
            response( cache[ term ] );
            return;
        }

        $.getJSON( "search.php", request, function( data, status, xhr ) {
            cache[ term ] = data;
            response( data );
        });
    }
});
