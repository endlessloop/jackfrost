J.A.C.K.F.R.O.S.T. (Jquery Auto Complete Kit For Remote Object Safe Targeting) is an autocomplete technology based on the jquery ui plugin which allows the search and pick of remote objects (i.e. stored model objects) from the front end as a field value, supporting any dataset/query and having that object at the server side.
